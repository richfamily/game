# Emergency Avatar System

This system provides a reliable way for players to get their starter avatar even if the normal avatar system fails. It's designed to work independently of any other systems in the game.

## How It Works

1. The `EmergencyAvatarButton.lua` script in StarterGui creates a red emergency button at the bottom of the screen.
2. When the player clicks this button, it:
   - Creates the Remotes folder in ReplicatedStorage if it doesn't exist
   - Creates the GetStarterAvatar RemoteEvent if it doesn't exist
   - Fires the GetStarterAvatar RemoteEvent
   - Shows a success message
   - Removes itself from the screen

3. The `EmergencyAvatarHandler.lua` script in ServerScriptService:
   - Creates the necessary RemoteEvents on the server side
   - Handles the GetStarterAvatar RemoteEvent
   - Creates a starter avatar for the player
   - Notifies the player that they received an avatar

## Why This Approach Works

The previous approach was failing because it was waiting for the Remotes folder to exist, but the Remotes folder was never being created. This new approach:

1. **Creates the necessary RemoteEvents** if they don't exist, rather than waiting for them
2. **Works independently** of any other systems in the game
3. **Provides clear feedback** to the player about what's happening
4. **Has minimal dependencies** - it only depends on basic Roblox services that are guaranteed to exist

## Implementation Details

### Client-Side (EmergencyAvatarButton.lua)

- Located in StarterGui, so it's automatically given to every player
- Creates a visible button that players can click
- Creates the necessary RemoteEvents if they don't exist
- Provides visual feedback to the player

### Server-Side (EmergencyAvatarHandler.lua)

- Located in ServerScriptService, so it runs on the server
- Creates the necessary RemoteEvents on the server side
- Creates a starter avatar for the player
- Handles errors gracefully

## Troubleshooting

If a player reports that they can't get their starter avatar:

1. Check if the EmergencyAvatarButton is visible on their screen
2. Check the server logs for any errors related to avatar creation
3. Make sure the player has a Character with a HumanoidRootPart (the avatar is welded to this)

## Future Improvements

Once the main avatar system is working reliably, you can:

1. Make the emergency button less prominent or only show it after a delay
2. Add more sophisticated error handling
3. Integrate this system with the main avatar system

## Important Notes

- This system creates a simple blue ball as the starter avatar. You can customize this to match your game's aesthetic.
- The avatar is welded to the player's HumanoidRootPart and follows them around.
- The system checks if the player already has an avatar before creating a new one.
